## Why E-waste Management Matters

E-waste management is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Environmental Impact**: E-waste often contains hazardous materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can harm the environment when improperly disposed of.

2. **Resource Conservation**: Proper recycling of e-waste can help recover valuable resources like gold, silver, and copper, reducing the need for new mining.

3. **Energy Efficiency**: Recycling electronics uses less energy than mining and processing raw materials.

4. **Health and Safety**: Exposure to toxic materials in e-waste can have severe health consequences.

5. **Sustainable Practices**: Promoting e-waste recycling aligns with sustainability and circular economy goals.
